<h1>Christmas Letter</h1>
<h3>Dear Dad,<br>
I want to take this special moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you’ve done for me. No words can truly capture how much I appreciate your love, care, and countless sacrifices. You’ve been my support, my motivator, and my greatest inspiration.</h3>

<h3>Thank you for being there through every high and low, for offering comfort when I needed it most, and for guiding me with your wisdom and patience. Even when I stumbled, your unwavering love always shone through. I see and cherish everything you do, and it means the world to me.</h3>

<h3>You've instilled in me the values of strength, perseverance, and integrity—lessons I carry with me every day. I’m incredibly fortunate to have you as my dad, and I hope you know how deeply loved and appreciated you are.</h3>

<h3>I promise to do my best to make you proud and to return even a small portion of the love and care you’ve given me. Thank you for being such an amazing father.</h3>

<h3>With all my love,<br>
Zenji</h3>
